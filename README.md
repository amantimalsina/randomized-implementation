# Implementation of some of my favorite randomized algorithms

This repository concerns some of my favorite randomized algorithms. 
The primary reason for my implementation of these particular algorithms is their simplicity. 
However, a secondary reason is that the analysis of these algorithm have an underlying connection to a deeper theory in computer science/mathematics 
or useful techniques and this gave me a chance to review some of those. 

The notebooks themselves contain both the discussion and context behind these algorithms, along with their implementation with concrete examples in python.
