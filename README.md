# Implementation of some of my favorite randomized algorithms

This repository concerns some of my favorite randomized algorithms.
The primary reason for my implementation of these particular algorithms is their simplicity. 
However, a secondary reason is either the algorithms have an underlying connection to a deeper theory in computer science/mathematics 
or their analyses have useful techniques, and this gave me a chance to review some of those. 

The notebooks themselves contain both the context behind these algorithms and their implementations with concrete examples in Python.
