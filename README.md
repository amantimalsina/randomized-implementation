# Implementation of one of my favorite randomized algorithms: The Fiedler's Algorithm

This repository concerns the implementation of my favorite randomized algorithm. The primary reason for my implementation of this particular algorithms is its simplicity. However, a secondary reason is that the algorithm has an underlying connection to a deeper theory in computer science/mathematics, namely the Cheeger's Inequality.

The notebook itself contains both the context behind Fiedler's algorithm and its implementation with concrete examples in Python.
