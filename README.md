# Implementation of some of my favorite randomized algorithms

This repository concerns the implementation of my favorite randomized algorithm. Currently, the implementation only consists of the Fiedler's algorithm for approximating the minimum conductance. I plan to implement the Bartal's algorithm for randomized tree metrics and the randomized sampling algorithm.

## Fiedler's Algorithm
The primary reason for my implementation of Fiedler's is its simplicity. However, a secondary reason is that the algorithm has an underlying connection to a deeper theory in computer science/mathematics, namely the Cheeger's Inequality. The implementation helps me review the related concepts. The notebook itself contains both the context behind Fiedler's algorithm and its implementation with concrete examples in Python.
